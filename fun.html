                            Blog</a></p>
                    <p><strong><em>This was a blog post written during my internship Cisco Systems, about my experiences
                                as a virtual intern who went into my local office, and about the lasting friendships I
                                built.</em></strong></p>
                    <p>When I first stepped into the office, I felt like the new kid at school again. None of my team
                        worked in Chicago, and with so many hybrid workers, the office wasn’t full. I took my time
                        exploring every inch of the new workspace, tentatively searching for a spot where I felt like I
                        could fit in. Everyone talks about how the most important part of your internship is the
                        connections you make, but my hands still shook a bit at the thought of socializing. My first
                        week flew by, and I had yet to gather the courage to approach anyone.</p>
                    <p>I like to tell people that my short-term career goal was to work somewhere with latte machines.
                        The Cisco Meraki Chicago office must have heard my prayers when they installed five instant
                        machines alongside two much fancier espresso machines. Unfortunately, I was illiterate in
                        whatever language baristas used to churn out the drinks I craved. While I had two dilemmas: a
                        latte shortage, and loneliness in the open office in which I was a newcomer, I had one solution
                        for both.</p>
                    <p>I first met Felipe during a lunch break in a pantry, but I’d seen him using the espresso machines
                        in the morning. We talked briefly, and I, hoping to extend the lifespan of the conversation,
                        brought up my desire to use the espresso machines. “Lucky for you,” he said, a smile spreading
                        across his face, “I can teach you!” Looking back, Felipe was probably just as eager to make a
                        connection as I was. We became good friends, bonding over coffee, coding, music, and joking
                        about my methods of making friends. Coffee critiques became conversation starters, and we’d come
                        up with things to do for afternoon tea breaks. “Hey, have you tried matcha?” “I got boba at this
                        new place,” “Let’s try making chai!” helped lay the foundation for a strong friendship to stand
                        on. My proficiency as an amateur barista grew, as did my confidence to socialize.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Three weeks into latte-making, I got to pass my knowledge on. Angel and I’s friendship started at
                        the espresso machine when he asked for a demo. A fellow technical intern, we started sitting
                        together and spent many afternoons giggling over terrible puns. I’ll get to watch him hone his
                        skills at the espresso machine.</p>
                    <p>Luckily for me, Angel and Felipe also hit it off well. One afternoon, we taste-tested a drink kit
                        Felipe got. Somehow, I was the only one who knew how to use a cocktail shaker. Other days, you’d
                        find us crowded around the espresso machine, combining our skills to make the best lattes.
                        Felipe pulled the best espresso, and I’d mastered steaming milk. While Felipe sat in an adjacent
                        open office, he’d come over to Angel’s and my block to chat often. Usually about my silly
                        statuses. (Some highlights include: “Cascading Style Sheets? More like Creating Stressful
                        Situations.” and “Ask me about my bird’s pants.”)</p>
                    <p>My relationships with Angel and Felipe are just two of the many I’ve built here at Cisco Meraki
                        Chicago. I was introduced to some of Felipe’s friends, who introduced me to even more people.
                        I’ve garnered the courage to approach others on my own during office events. Now, I’ve got a
                        blue sticky note on my monitor, filled with the names of all the people I’ve met during my all
                        too short internship. Just like how my morning latte art attempts improved from fluffy clouds
                        blobs to basic hearts, I am taking new encounters in stride, each one easier than the last.</p>

                    <p>
                        The birdie that started it all. Prince is an ornery old man, but I think he’s got a soft spot
                        for me, since he’s happy to spend a whole day on my shoulder. He sings very melodically, and
                        absolutely hates water. He also really likes Cheerio, and begs for scritches from her at night.

                    <h4>Cheerio (female lovebird, b. 2016)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The bully of the family. Cheerio might be the smallest bird, but she’s got the biggest
                        personality. Nothing is safe from Cheerio's desire to shred. She loves newspaper and cardboard,
                        and we're never surprised when a tissue box is missing half of it's top. She’s feared by all the
                        other birds, and the family’s cat. Despite being an agent of chaos, Cheerio is surprisingly friendly with all humans, and enjoys being held and scratched on her head.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Toto (male cockatiel, b. 2017)
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        We adopted Toto in July of 2022. Even at the shelter, he was almost immediately excited to see
                        us, and stood out from the room full of cockatiels as the most social little guy. He sings to me
                        in the mornings, dances when I brush my hair, and is a strong but clumsy flier. He likes sitting
                        on our heads, but unlike Prince, is not a very polite pooper. While Toto knows how to step up,
                        he usually refuses to since he’s realized he can do whatever he wants and we’ll love him
                        anyways.

                    <p>Ever since learning barista basics during my software engineering internship, I've continued
                        working on my latte art.</p>
                    <p>Let's look at the funny ones first. These were done using my roommate's nespresso vertuo and
                        aeroccino, which produced great espresso. Since the aeroccino isn't a true steam wand, it was
                        difficult to get the even microfoam desired for a latte. This made it difficult to pour true
                        latte art. Instead, I had fun making silly animals. From left to right, we have the best
                        microfoam I'd gotten, which I turned into a bear... shrimp? Next, a bear and some hearts.
                        Lastly, a true latte heart (albeit small) as well as a cute little rabbit.</p>

                    <p>I got an espresso machine for my 22nd birthday, so I've started making bean juice with a side of
                        milk at home. My senior year roommates got me a nice WPM slow pour supply pitcher for my
                        birthday, and the pointed spout and thoughtful design make a big difference in the latte pours.
                        Some highlights: first, an absolutely gorgeous matcha I might not ever top, and a cortado I
                        poured during a lunchtime visit to see Felipe at the Cisco Meraki office</p>
